![poster](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d0d7b8f4-d4d3-4901-8fdf-af84d5228ade)


This repository documents my personal frontend challenge:
building one website every day for 31 days.

The goal of this challenge is to improve consistency, strengthen my
frontend fundamentals, and gain hands-on experience by shipping daily.

## Why this challenge?

Instead of waiting for perfect projects, I chose to build every day.
This challenge helps me:
- Stay consistent and disciplined
- Improve UI/UX and layout skills
- Practice animations and interactions
- Learn faster through real-world website concepts

## What’s inside this repository?

Each folder represents one day of the challenge.
Every folder contains a complete, standalone website built from scratch.

All websites focus on:
- Clean UI and modern layouts
- Responsive, mobile-first design
- Smooth animations where needed

## Tech stack

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
(Animations)
- GSAP
- LENIS
- SPLINE
- SWIPER.js
- Anime.js

  ## How to explore the projects

1. Open any `day-XX` folder
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
3. Explore the design, layout, and animations


## Progress

I’ll update this repository daily as I complete each website.
The goal is simple: show up and ship every day for 31 days.

## Final note

This repository is not about perfection.
It’s about consistency, learning, and growth.

Thanks for checking it out.
